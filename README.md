A chat application using OpenAI's API for language practice via conversation with AI. This is a continuation of a project that began at UNC's HackNC but never got to see fruition. 

As of now, the user has the choice of a few premade prompts to serve as a guideline for what topic to discuss, but they have no real impact on the discussion itself should the user choose to talk about something else. OpenAI's API provides AI responses to user input, though as of now there is no memory of previous messages, so the AI will act as if the only part of the conversation it has seen is the current message.
